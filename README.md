# UFOs
## Overview
### The overview of this project is using a javascript file filled with UFO data, we manipulateed the data using filters and posted the file in a tidy HTML page. 
## Analysis
### The end result that we ended coming up with was well designed HTML page that uses filters to show the UFO data that meets the criteria.

## Summary 
### While I think that the webpage is pretty nifty one drawback is that, it just filters and shows the stationary data.
### On this note one suggestion would be to include a link to an article that goes into a more in depth descrition on the event
### One other suggestion that I have is that it would be nice to have a count on the bottom of the results to quickly show how many of those events have occured that match the chosen filters (ie if you looking for how many were light shaped, it would display 26, instead of having to count by hand)
